# Introduction 
I want to create a portfolio of loans/disbursements. (Loan Portfolio) It will help people who have several loans in different banks, or take several things in installments, to keep all information in one place. The program will calculate the minimum payments that should be paid in a certain period, for example a month, taking into account the interest on the loan, installments, so that the debt does not grow and will recommend what amount should be paid every month in order to pay off all the debts for the period chosen by you. The main algorithms will be the algorithms for calculating different situations depending on the input data of the portfolio. Authorization, integration with MS SQL database and other technical requirements will be created.
